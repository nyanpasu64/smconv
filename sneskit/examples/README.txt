I don't know who it was who had started converting some of the Anthrox demos to CA65/SNESKit. I fixed some bugs and oddities and cleaned some stuff up. This is all a work in progress. Some stuff needs to be better documented.

I've included additional sources I had access to. Where possible I included the orginal source code as I've made changes beyond converting to SNESKit. Usually the changes are to reduce code size and/or seperate out routines for easy use elsewhere.

Enjoy!
