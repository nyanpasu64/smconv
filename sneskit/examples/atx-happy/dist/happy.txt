Hi Folks! It's been a while since I've done anything and a lot of peeps
bugged me about doing "How To Code SNES volume 2", but screw it :)

Instead I've decided to do something different and still let ya play with
the source codes.
 

Included in this archive are 2 simple demos.

the first demo uses:

Mode 2  (2 16 color planes, with the ability to change vertical/horizontal
         offset for each column)
HDMA    (2 channels controlling 2121 and 2122 for colors)
GDMA    (1 channel to copy sprite data to sprite ram)
Music   (taken from Bio-Metal US Final. this song is easy to use in any demo)
Sprites (controls 32 sprites on the screen and makes it move in a circular
         pattern and bounce off invisible borders.. got the idea of it after
         seeing it done on some old BROS demo on the C64..  simple to do..)
Joypad  (to control some functions of the demo, like song selection, changing
         sine patterns..)
NMI     (uses vertical blank interrupt, much easier to use instead of waiting
         for vertical blanks constantly..)

the second demo uses:

Mode 0  ( 1 1 color plane with flexing scroller)
GDMA    ( transfers 2k during vertical blank)



The source codes are very nice and informative, almost every line has a
description of what it is doing!
 

They were assembled using SASM v1.4 (unregistered '030 version) and should
easily be converted for use on any other cross-assembler out there.
No macros were used since I'm not sure how other assemblers would use macros.
I wanted them to convert easily to other assemblers.
 
some things you might need to watch out for:
dcr.w = takes a word like $8000 and reverses it to $00,$80
        (65xx works backwards..)
        this is an assembler instruction which might be different on another
        assembler
 
commands such as:
jsl >song = the ">" means to read a 24 bit address. This command is standard
            and should work on all assemblers, if not then get a different
            assembler! :)

.bin = includes a binary file

.pad = fills up a bank with zeros so it can get to the next bank

heap = stack size

size = number of bank/blocks to create

SMC+ = make SMC header

lrom = lo-rom


Ok that's about enuff of troubleshooting..

Software used to create the Happy New Year demo:

SASM 1.4 by Florian W. Sauer & Stefan M. Schulze;Infernal Byte, INC.
IFF2SNES by Morris of Focus
SINEGEN V1.2  by  ·STARRAY of the MECHANICAL MINDS INC
                  ·CAD MANGO of ITALIAN BAD BOYS
SUPER MAGIC DISASSEMBLER by -Pan- of Anthrox (me! needed for ripping sound)
CLOANTO PERSONAL PAINT (and a disk full of fonts)

Software used to create the Flex demo:

SASM 1.4 by Florian W. Sauer & Stefan M. Schulze;Infernal Byte, INC.
CYBER FONT-EDITOR V1.4  Rel. by Frantic (c) 1991-1992 Sanity Productions
SINEGEN V1.2  by  ·STARRAY of the MECHANICAL MINDS INC
                  ·CAD MANGO of ITALIAN BAD BOYS



Hardware used to create the demos:

Amiga 4000/040
Super ProCom    (the Wildcard was too buggy with the PC-LINK..)
NTSC SNES


Thanks to Loverman for the nice account...  that way I could leech Bio-Metal!

happy.s   = source code for the happy new year demo
happy.dat = happy new year 1994 graphics (converted to SNES 16 color format
                                          using IFF2SNES)
char.dat  = character set (letter font) also converted to SNES 16 colors

flex.smc  = flex demo to use on your copier (err.. BACKUP-SYSTEM)
FILE_ID.DIZ = description for uploading to other boards..
 
Everything else you can DELETE as it's just an advert for a board!
