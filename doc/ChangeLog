	to be in ab-nofx.

2017-04-01 Augustus Blackheart:
	* drivers/celes-0.1h: brought ab-fm-nofx out of hiding as
	Celes.

2017-03-30 Augustus Blackheart:
	* drivers/supernofx-0.5.h: uncommented wt_min and wt_max

	* drivers/pitchmod-1.2.h, drivers/snesmod-1.3.h: moved driver
	base from $3c4->$400. Using address $3c4 saved 60 bytes and

	broke playback on every single SPC player I tried it on.

	Thanks to b00daw and Savestate for letting me know SPC playback
	was broken.

	driver base from $400->$3c4, freed up some ram. Deleted CmdExTab_H:
	all of these commands are at $0exx
	* drivers/snesmod-1.3.h: added ADSR support, same as the
	PitchMod version.

2017-01-05 Augustus Blackheart:
	* drivers/supernofx-0.5.h: Saved some bytes in Command_Tempo and
	removed high bytes from tables where all routines within a jump
	table contained the same high byte (such as S4xTab_H).
	* examples/pwm.*: updated with the higher quality samples from
	ABNoFX.

2017-01-03 Augustus Blackheart:
