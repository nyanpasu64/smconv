[PATTERN 0]

	[Channel 03]				[Channel 04]

000:	S9C (Z11-4F will set delay between
	     cycle)

002:	Z4F set wavetable delay to 252
             (4Fh-10h)*4

018:						S48 (enable wavetable cycle)

026:	Z30 set wavetable delay to 128

[PATTERN 2] (This blends back and forth between two samples)

02f:						S49 (disable wavetable cycle)









Note:
* No volume envelope was used for Sample 1 so many different volume
options may be used.

  Another option is to use the same waveform in multiple slots with different
volume envelopes.
